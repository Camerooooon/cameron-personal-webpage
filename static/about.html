              <p>I love taking photographs, you can find my favorite photographs in my portfolio. Most of the photographs I have taken were from the Sacramento area however I often bring my camera with me when I hike and go camping. My main camera is a Sony a6400 and my most commonly used lens is a 18-150mm kit lens. My favorite subjects are mountains and trees but I take all kinds of photos ranging from landscapes to buzzing bees. If you are interested in purchasing a print of any of my art work or you are interested in photography please email me.</p>

              <p>I've been programming since 2013, seriously, I've found dated notebooks where I've hand written working python code into the pages. It's no secret that computers have been a big part of my life, to this day I still focus on learning anything I can about computers. Currently, my absolute favorite programming language is Rust. The type safety and costless abstraction presented by the Rust programming language is why I love it so much. My first programming language was Python, which is my personal recommendation for new programmers choosing an new language. Currently I'm a part of the programming subteam on FRC team, Citrus Circuits. I also work on some personal projects that you can find on my GitHub. Finally, I maintain my server network where I self host a lot of the service I use in my daily life.</p>

I'm an amateur radio operator, my call sign is KN6YZZ, usually you can hear my calling on the K6MVR repeater located on top of Mt.Vaca in the Sacramento area. I am a member of the Yolo Amateur Radio Society Radio Club and I regularly partake in club meetings and the weekly nets. I've been interested in ham radio since I got my license in 03/21/2023. Usually I bring my large antenna with me on hikes and connected it to my handheld in order to make simplex contacts. Currently I am working on upgrading my home station to a larger antenna system with an HF radio.</p>

              I love the outdoors and going outside. I try to go on a hike every week as long as I am not busy. My favorite hike in the Sacramento area is Stebbins Cold Canyon. Whenever I go hiking I always bring my camera equipment and my ham radio. My favorite part of being in the wilderness is when the cell service goes out because I personally hate social media platforms. The lack of internet it forces all my friend take a break from social media.</p>
